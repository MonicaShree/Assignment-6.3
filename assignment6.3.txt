Explain the working of below pig script commands with an example:

1. LOAD

  * Loads the data in the Pig. 

  * Eg: relation_name = LOAD 'input file path' USING function as schema;

2. STORE
  
  * Used to store the data in the file system after the data is loaded in file system.

  * Eg: STORE relation_name INTO 'directory_path' USING function;


3. DUMP

  * It is used to print the contents of the relation on the console.

  * Eg:DUMP relation_name;

4. FOREACH

  * It is used to generate specified data transformations oon column data.

  * Eg:relation_name2 = FOREACH relation_name GENERATE (data);

5. FILTER

  * Based on a specified condition it selects the tuples from the relation and filters the data and displays it .

  * Eg:relation_name3 = FILTER relation_name BY (condition).

6. GROUP BY

  * The group by operator is used to group the data.

  * The data is grouped into one or more relation.

  * Eg:group_relation = GROUP relation_name BY data;

7. ORDER BY

  * The order by operator is used to display the contents of the relation in sorted order.

  * Eg:relation3 = ORDER relation_name BY (ASC|DESC);
  

8. DESCRIBE 
  * The describe command is used to view the schema of the relation.

  * Eg:DESCRIBE relation_name;
